**EasyISO** is a simple and intuitive tool for converting `.iso` folders into real `.iso` files. It also offers the option to create `.vmo` virtual environment files (currently experimental and may be fixed in future versions).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Drag & Drop** `.iso` folders into the program for easy conversion.  
- Choose to create either:  
  - **`.iso`** – A standard ISO file.  
  - **`.vmo`** – A virtual environment file (currently experimental).  
- Designed for **Windows 11** (full support for other OSes may come in the future).  

> ⚠️ **Important:** The folder name must include `.iso` for the program to recognize it.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Drag your `.iso` folder into the EasyISO program.  
2. Select your desired output: `.iso` or `.vmo`.  
3. Wait for the conversion to complete.
